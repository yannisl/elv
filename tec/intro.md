## Priorities

The biggest priority is to work out, what is needed in terms of DDC Control Panels, detail them and order them.

The number of drawings required are as follows:

1.  Section 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the Dome Areas.
2.  Technical 1.
3.  Basements.
4.  Gather requirements for any interfaces.
5.  Electrical Monitoring. 

Works have started at high level and we need to find out how to cover it.
